## Setup

To setup the repository do the following steps:

```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/constantinius/geotiff.js.git
cd geotiff.js/

# install development dependencies
npm install
```

## Testing and Building

In order to run the tests you first have to set up the test data. This requires
the [GDAL](http://gdal.org/) and [ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org/) tools.
Installation of these tools varies according to the operating system, the
following listing shows the installation on Ubuntu (using the ubuntugis-unstable
repository):
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gdal-bin imagemagick
```
To install GDAL and ImageMagick on MacOS X, please use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). The setup script also needs `wget` on MacOS X
```bash
brew install wget gdal imagemagick
```

When GDAL and ImageMagick is installed, the test data setup script can be run:
```bash
cd test/data
sh setup_data.sh
cd -
```

To test the library (using PhantomJS, karma, mocha and chai) do the following:

```bash
npm test
```

To do some in-browser testing do:

```bash
npm run dev
```

and navigate to `http://localhost:8090/index.html`

To build the library do:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output is written to `dist-browser/main.js` and `dist-node/main.js`.

## Install

You can install geotiff.js using npm:
```
npm install geotiff
```

or you can use the prebuilt version with a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/geotiff"></script>
```
Note: Currently the CDN installation is not compatible with GeoTIFF workers pool `GeoTIFF.Pool`.


## Usage

geotiff.js works with both `require`, `import` and the global variable `GeoTIFF`:

```javascript
const GeoTIFF = require('geotiff');
const { fromUrl, fromUrls, fromArrayBuffer, fromBlob } = GeoTIFF;

// or
import GeoTIFF, { fromUrl, fromUrls, fromArrayBuffer, fromBlob } from 'geotiff';
```

or:

```html
<script async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/geotiff"></script>
<script>
  console.log(GeoTIFF);
  // Note: GeoTIFF.Pool will not work
</script>
```

To parse a GeoTIFF, first a data source is required. To help with the development,
there are shortcuts available. The following creates a source that reads from a
remote GeoTIFF referenced by a URL:

```javascript
fromUrl(someUrl)
  .then(tiff => { /* ... */});

// or when using async/await
(async function() {
  const tiff = await fromUrl(someUrl);
  // ...
})()
```

Note: the interactions with geotiff.js objects are oftentimes asynchronous. For
the sake of brevity we will only show the async/await syntax and not the
`Promise` based one in the following examples.

Accessing remote images is just one way to open TIFF images with geotiff.js. Other
options are reading from a local `ArrayBuffer`:

```javascript
// using local ArrayBuffer
const response = await fetch(someUrl);
const arrayBuffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
const tiff = await fromArrayBuffer(arrayBuffer);
```

or a `Blob`/`File`:

```html
<input type="file" id="file">
<script>
  const input = document.getElementById('file'):
  input.onchange = async function() {
    const tiff = await fromBlob(input.files[0]);
  }
</script>
```

Now that we have opened the TIFF file, we can inspect it. The TIFF is structured
in a small header and a list of one or more images (Image File Directory, IFD to
use the TIFF nomenclature). To get one image by index the `getImage()` function
must be used. This is again an asynchronous operation, as the IFDs are loaded
lazily:

```javascript
const image = await tiff.getImage(); // by default, the first image is read.
```

Now that we have obtained a `GeoTIFFImage` object we can inspect its metadata
(like size, tiling, number of samples, geographical information, etc.). All
the metadata is parsed once the IFD is first parsed, thus the access to that
is synchronous:

```javascript
const width = image.getWidth();
const height = image.getHeight();
const tileWidth = image.getTileWidth();
const tileHeight = image.getTileHeight();
const samplesPerPixel = image.getSamplesPerPixel();

// when we are actually dealing with geo-data the following methods return
// meaningful results:
const origin = image.getOrigin();
const resolution = image.getResolution();
const bbox = image.getBoundingBox();
```

The actual raster data is not fetched and parsed automatically. This is because
it is usually much more spacious and the decoding of the pixels can be time
consuming due to the necessity of decompression.

To read a whole image into one big array of arrays the following method call can be used:

```javascript
const data = await image.readRasters();
```

For convenience the result always has a `width` and `height` attribute:

```javascript
const data = await image.readRasters();
const { width, height } = data;
```

By default, the raster is split to a separate array for each component. For an RGB image
for example, we'd get three arrays, one for red, green and blue.

```javascript
const [red, green, blue] = await image.readRasters();
```

If we want instead all the bands interleaved in one big array, we have to pass the
`interleave: true` option:

```javascript
const [r0, g0, b0, r1, g1, b1, ...] = await image.readRasters({ interleave: true });
```

If we are only interested in a specific region of the image, the `window` option can be
used to limit reading in that bounding box. Note: the bounding box is in 'image coordinates'
not geographical ones:

```javascript
const left = 50;
const top = 10;
const right = 150;
const bottom = 60;

const data = await image.readRasters({ window: [left, top, right, bottom] });
```

This image window can go beyond the image bounds. In that case it might be usefull to supply
a `fillValue: value` option (can also be an array, one value for each sample).

It is also possible to just read specific samples for each pixel. For example, we can only
read the red component from an RGB image:

```javascript
const [red] = await image.readRasters({ samples: [0] });
```

When you want your output in a specific size, you can use the `width` and `height` options.
This defaults of course to the size of your supplied `window` or the image size if no
`window` was supplied.

As the data now needs to be resampled, a `resampleMethod` can be specified. This defaults to
the nearest neighbour method, but also the `'bilinear'` method is supported:

```javascript
const data = await image.readRasters({ width: 40, height: 40, resampleMethod: 'bilinear' });
```

### Using decoder pools to improve parsing performance

Decoding compressed images can be a time consuming process. To minimize this
geotiff.js provides the `Pool` mechanism which uses WebWorkers to split the amount
of work on multiple 'threads'.

```javascript
const pool = new GeoTIFF.Pool();
const data = await image.readRasters({ pool });
```

It is possible to provide a pool size (i.e: number of workers), by default the number
of available processors is used.

Because of the way WebWorker work (pun intended), there is a considerable overhead
involved when using the `Pool`, as all the data must be copied and cannot be simply be
shared. But the benefits are two-fold. First: for larger image reads the overall time
is still likely to be reduced and second: the main thread is relieved which helps to
uphold responsiveness.

If you want to use the Worker Pool in a project built with webpack (ex: VueJS or React) you have to install `threads-plugin` and add the plugin to your `webpack.config.js`:
```
npm install -D threads-plugin
```

```javascript
const ThreadsPlugin = require('threads-plugin')

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new ThreadsPlugin()
  ]
}
````

### Dealing with visual data

The TIFF specification provides various ways to encode visual data. In the
specification this is called photometric interpretation. The simplest case we
already dealt with is the RGB one. Others are grayscale, paletted images, CMYK,
YCbCr, and CIE L*a*b.

geotiff.js provides a method to automatically convert these images to RGB:
`readRGB()`. This method is very similar to the `readRasters` method with
distinction that the `interleave` option is now always `true` and the
`samples` are automatically chosen.

```javascript
const rgb = await image.readRGB({
  // options...
});
```

### Automatic image selection (experimental)

When dealing with images that have internal (or even external, see the next section)
overviews, `GeoTIFF` objects provide a separate `readRasters` method. This method
works very similar to the method on the `GeoTIFFImage` objects with the same name.
By default, it uses the larges image available (highest resolution), but when either
`width`, `height`, `resX`, or `resY` are specified, then the best fitting image will
be used for reading.

Additionally, it allows the `bbox` instead of the `window` parameter. This works
similarly, but uses geographic coordinates instead of pixel ones.

```javascript
const data = await tiff.readRasters({
  bbox: [10.34, 57.28, 13.34, 60.23],
  resX: 0.1,
  resY: 0.1
});
```

### External overviews

Especially for certain kinds of high resolution images it is not uncommon to separate
the highest resolution from the lower resolution overviews (usually using the `.ovr`
extension). With geotiff.js it is possible to use files of this setup, just as you
would use single-file images by taking advantage of the `MultiGeoTIFF` objects. They
behave exactly the same as the before mentioned `GeoTIFF` objects: you can select
images by index or read data using `readRasters`. Toget such a file use the `fromUrls`
factory function:

```javascript
const multiTiff = await fromUrls(
  'LC08_L1TP_189027_20170403_20170414_01_T1_B3.TIF',
  ['LC08_L1TP_189027_20170403_20170414_01_T1_B3.TIF.ovr']
);
```

### AbortController Support

Geotiff.js supports the use of [`AbortController`s](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController). Calls to `getRasters`, `readRGB` and `getTileOrStrip` will throw an `Error` with name `AbortSignal` similar to the browser's `fetch` behavior.

In order to enable this, when you make the tiff source, you need to set the `cacheSize` parameter to `0` due to cache consistency issues - otherwise, once the cache becomes full,
it will lose its consistency.

```javascript
const tiff = await fromUrl(source, { cacheSize: 0 });
```

```javascript
const abortController = new AbortController();
const { signal } = abortController;
abortController.abort();
try {
  const data = await tiff.readRasters({ signal });
} catch(e) {
  if (err.name === 'AbortError') {
    // do stuff
  }
}
```

### Writing GeoTIFFs (Beta Version)

You can create a binary representation of a GeoTIFF using `writeArrayBuffer`.
This function returns an ArrayBuffer which you can then save as a .tif file.
:warning: writeArrayBuffer currently writes the values uncompressed
```javascript
import GeoTIFF, { writeArrayBuffer } from 'geotiff';

const values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
const metadata = {
  height: 3,
  width: 3
};
const arrayBuffer = await writeArrayBuffer(values, metadata);
```

You can also customize the metadata using names found in the [TIFF Spec](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/content/tiff_tags.shtml) and [GeoTIFF spec](https://cdn.earthdata.nasa.gov/conduit/upload/6852/geotiff-1.8.1-1995-10-31.pdf).
```javascript
import { writeArrayBuffer } from 'geotiff';

const values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
const metadata = {
  height: 3,
  ModelPixelScale: [0.031355, 0.031355, 0],
  ModelTiepoint: [0, 0, 0, 11.331755000000001, 46.268645, 0],
  width: 3
};
const arrayBuffer = await writeArrayBuffer(values, metadata);
```

## What to do with the data?

There is a nice HTML 5/WebGL based rendering library called
[plotty](https://github.com/santilland/plotty), that allows for some really nice
on the fly rendering of the data contained in a GeoTIFF.

```html
<canvas id="plot"></canvas>
<script>
  // ...

  (async function() {
    const tiff = await fromUrl(url);
    const image = await tiff.getImage();
    const data = await image.readRasters();

    const canvas = document.getElementById("plot");
    const plot = new plotty.plot({
      canvas,
      data: data[0],
      width: image.getWidth(),
      height: image.getHeight(),
      domain: [0, 256],
      colorScale: "viridis"
    });
    plot.render();
  })();
</script>
```

## BigTIFF support

geotiff.js has a limited support for files in the BigTIFF format. The limitations
originate in the capabilities of current JavaScript implementations regarding
64 bit integer parsers and structures: there are no functions to read 64 bit
integers from a stream and no such typed arrays. As BigTIFF relies on 64 bit
offsets and also allows tag values of those types. In order to still provide
a reasonable support, the following is implemented:

  * 64 bit integers are read as two 32 bit integers and then combined. As
    numbers in JavaScript are typically implemented as 64 bit floats, there
    might be inaccuracies for *very* large values.
  * For 64 bit integer arrays, the default `Array` type is used. This might
    cause problems for some compression algorithms if those arrays are used for
    pixel values.

## n-bit Support

geotiff.js has some n-bit support which means that it supports unsigned integer
data reading with each element using a non-multiple of 8 bit depth. This only
works with band interleaved images (see
[this related issue](https://github.com/geotiffjs/geotiff.js/issues/202)).

## Planned stuff:

  * Better support of geospatial parameters:
    * Parsing of EPSG identifiers
    * WKT representation

## Acknowledgements

This library was inspired by
[GeotiffParser](https://github.com/xlhomme/GeotiffParser.js). It provided a
great starting point, but lacked the capabilities to read the raw raster data
which is the aim of geotiff.js.
